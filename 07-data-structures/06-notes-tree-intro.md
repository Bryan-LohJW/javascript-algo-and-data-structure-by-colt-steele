**Tree**

- a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent-child relationship
- the top most node is the root
- trees are nonlinear
- a singly linked list is a special sort of tree
- every node must be moving away from the root node
- must have only one root
- a child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- a parent is the converse notion of a child
- siblings are a group of nodes with the same parent
- a leaf is a node with no children
- the edge is the connection between one node and another

Applications of trees

- HTML DOM
- network routing
- Abstract syntax trees
- Artificial intelligence
- folders in operating systems
- computer file systems

Kinds of trees

- binary tree
- - every parent node has at most two children;
- binary search trees
- - every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
