**Divide and Conquer**

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.

This pattern includes many different algorithms such as merge sort, binary search etc.

The general pattern is to divide larger data into smaller chunks that may be easier to work with.

For example, binary search inside a sorted array divides the remaining search array by half after every iteration. This is much better in terms of linear search ( O(log n) vs O(n) )
