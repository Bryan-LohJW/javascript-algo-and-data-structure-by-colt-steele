**Problem Solving Approach**

What is an algorithm?

- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

- Almost everything that we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm, it is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

- To improve:
- - Devise a plan for solving problems
- - Master common problem solving patterns

Problem solving approach

- The approach to problem solving can be broken down into 5 steps
- - understand the problem
- - explore concrete examples
- - break it down
- - solve/simplify
- - look back and refactor

Understand the problem

- can i restate the problem in my own words?
- what are the inputs that go into the problem?
- what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Explore concrete examples

- Coming up with examples can help us understand the problem better
- Examples also provide sanity checks that our eventual solution works how it should

- - start with simple examples
- - progress to more complex examples
- - explore examples with empty inputs
- - explore examples with invalid inputs

- - - basically figure out through examples what the expectation of the results should be, and figure out intricacies about the problem that will affect how we come up with the solution

Break it down

- Explicitly write out the steps we need to take
- - forces us to think about the code we will write before we write it, and helps us catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before we dive in and have to worry about details as well

Solve or simplify

- solve the problem, if we can't, solve a simpler problem

- simplify
- - find the core difficulty in what we are trying to do
- - temporarily ignore that difficulty
- - write a simplified solution
- - then incorporate that difficulty back in

Look back and refactor

- refactoring questions
- - can we check the results?
- - can we derive the results differently?
- - can we understand it at a glance?
- - can we use the result or method for some other problem?
- - can we improve the performance of our solution?
- - can we think of other ways to refactor?
- - how have other people solved this problem?
